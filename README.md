# Challenges for WiDS

Welcome to the **Women in Data Science: Py Night Challenge** (temporary) Github repository! The notebook in this repo contains the answers to the challenge questions, and the two files associated with the challenge. You are free to download or clone the repo, but unless you want to spoil the challenge, _don't open challenge.ipynb_ until you're ready to see the answers!

Good luck with the challenges!
